To help you find the information you need, the documentation is structured as follows:

- [Getting Started](./getting-started) walks you through how to install and use Resoto, step by step. Start here if you're new to Resoto.
<!-- - [How-To Guides](./how-to) provide guided instructions for specific use cases and scenarios. -->
- [Concepts](./concepts) describe key topics and ideas, and provide an overview of Resoto's architecture and components.
- [Reference](./reference) is a manual describing the CLI and data model. It is assumed that you have a basic understanding of important concepts.
<!-- - [Contributing](./contributing) lists instructions and guidelines for contributing to Resoto. -->

## What Is Resoto?

Resoto indexes resources, captures dependencies and maps out your infrastructure in an understandable graph. The graph contains metrics for each resource.

Developers and SREs can **search the graph with a query language**, and create **alerting and clean-up workflows**.

Metrics can be aggregated and exported to a time series database like Prometheus.

## Why Resoto?

Have you ever...

- had a standstill in your CI pipeline because a broken job leaked cloud resources and triggered a [quota limit](./reference/cli/query/examples.md#quota)?
- wanted to find all expired [certificates](./reference/cli/query/examples.md#certificate)?
- had to change the [tags](./reference/cli/tag.md) of thousands of EC2 instances?
- needed to delete all unused EBS [volumes](./reference/cli/query/examples.md#volume) with no I/O in the past month?
- wished for an aggregate view of resource usage across all cloud services?
- tediously created a report of the cost of a project across different accounts or cloud services?
- manually cleaned up orphaned [load balancers](./reference/cli/query/examples.md#aws_alb) that had no active backends?
- wanted to [automate](./concepts/automation/workflow.md) any of the above?

If you answered yes to any of the above, then Resoto was built to make your life easier!

## Supported Cloud Providers and Integrations

Resoto collects data using simple plugins written in [Python](https://www.python.org).

In addition to the above collector plugins, a [Slack](https://slack.com) plugin is also included for notification of resource cleanups.

:::tip
It is possible to write your own collector plugins! Please refer to the [example plugin in our GitHub repository](https://github.com/someengineering/resoto/tree/main/plugins/example_collector), and feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/someengineering) if we can be of any assistance.
